# 2.6:  Select all rows from the revenue table.

# sqlite> SELECT * FROM revenue;

# Please note that SQL queries end in a semicolon (;) and
# SQLite3 commands such as .tables and .schema do not:
# 
# adding a semicolon to a "dot" command (e.g. .schema; causes
# SQLite to ignore the command;
# 
# omitting a semicolon from a query causes SQLite to allow
# "multi-line" queries, which means it will wait until it sees
# the semicolon.
# 
# If you see a continuation line indicator (   ...> ) this
# means that you have started an SQL client and the client is
# waiting for more SQL (queries can be expressed in more than
# one line, so the client needs the semicolon to understand
# the end of the query).  If you're done, simply type the
# semicolon and hit [Enter].
