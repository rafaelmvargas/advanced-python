# 2.29:  Connect to a database and generate a cursor object.

# Remember that from exercise files, any data file will be
# located in the parent directory.  So the correct location
# for this week's database file is session_2.db.

# Confirm that you have connected to the existing database
# with this query:

# SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type= "table"

import runreport



# Expected Output:

# ('ad_companies',)
# ('ad_buys',)
# ('students',)
# ('revenue',)
# ('student_status',)
# ('user',)
# ('user_classes',)
# ('companyrev',)
# ('planets',)
