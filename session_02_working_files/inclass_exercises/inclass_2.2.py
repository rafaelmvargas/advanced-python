# 2.2:  In the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a Terminal window
# (Mac), travel to the project directory (look at the prompt
# (Windows) or use pwd (Mac) to see where you are (the present
# working directory); ls (Mac) or dir (Windows) to see what is
# in the present directory, and cd [dirname] to travel to a
# directory, or cd .. to travel into the parent directory.
# Launch sqlite with the command sqlite3.

# <BR>
# If you unzipped your project directory in the Downloads
# folder, the commands are:

# Mac:

# cd
# cd Downloads
# cd python_data
# cd session_02_files

# Windows:

# cd %HOMEPATH%
# cd Downloads
# cd python_data
# cd session_02_files

# If any command returns an error, check the spelling of your
# command.  If the 3rd command returns an error, check that
# the session_02_files folder was unzipped to your Downloads
# directory (and that you've spelled it correctly).

# start sqlite:

# sqlite3

# You should see the sqlite prompt:

# sqlite>

# You can quit out of sqlite with .quit:

# sqlite>  .quit
