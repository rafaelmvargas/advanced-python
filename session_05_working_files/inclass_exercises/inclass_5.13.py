# 5.13:  Given the following numbers, which were retrieved
# from a file as strings, sort the strings numerically without
# creating a new list.  (Hint:  based on your understanding
# that the key= argument to sorted() will in a sense process
# each element through whatever function we pass to it, use a
# function that converts numeric strings to integers.

# If you see a message similar to the one mentioned in the
# previous exercise, it means you've done something similar to
# the issue mentioned there.  Remember that key= references a
# function, it does not call it (thus we will not use
# parentheses).

mynums = ['5', '101', '10', '1', '3']

# your code here


# Expected Output:

# ['1', '3', '5', '10', '101']
