# 1.8:  Process individual words from a file.  Take the
# following steps, testing as you go:

#   1. Use file .read() to read pyku.txt as a whole
#   2. Use string .split() to divide the file into words
#   3. Loop through each word
#   4. As you loop, lowercase each word and strip of
# punctuation
#   5. Initialize a set() at the top, and .add() each word to
# the set to build a set of unique words.

fh = open('../pyku.txt')
