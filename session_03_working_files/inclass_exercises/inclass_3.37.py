# 3.37:  Add templates for /hello and /goodbye so that when
# the user visits, it returns a template rather than a string.

# The templates must be placed within a folder called
# template/ that is in the same directory as the script.
# 
# Here is the template to add for hello (hello.html, included
# in this session's files):

# <html>
#   <head><title>A Greeting</title></head>
#   <body>
#       <h1>Hello, Template!</h1>
#   </body>
# </html>

# Expected Output:

# Hello, Template!

# Here is the template to add for goodbye (goodbye.html,
# included in this session's files):

# <html>
#   <head><title>A Farewell</title></head>
#   <body>
#       <h1>Goodbye, now!  Come on back, y'hear?!</h1>
#   </body>
# </html>

# Expected Output:

# Goodbye, now!  Come on back, y'hear?!
