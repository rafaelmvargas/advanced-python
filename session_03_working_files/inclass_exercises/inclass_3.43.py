# 3.43:  Choose an image based on the user's dropdown choice.

# Now add the sadpup.jpg image to the static/images/ directory
# and modify the script so that it sends either image name to
# the template based on the user's "mood" choice.
# 
# Use the {% if [varname] == [value] %}  {% else %}  {% endif
# %} construct to have the template show either the happup.jpg
# or sadpup.jpg image.
# 
# Also, place the caption string beneath the image.
# 
# Expected Output:
# You should see the happup.jpg or sadpup.jpg image displayed
# along with a caption beneath.
