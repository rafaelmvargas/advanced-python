# 3.38:  Add a "static" HTML page with a link that calls the
# hello/ function, and another link that calls the goodbye/
# function.

# This page has been added as launch.html, also in the
# templates/ directory.

# <html>
#   <head><title>Launch</title></head>
#   <body>
#     <h1>Launch!</h1>
#     <A HREF="http://localhost:5000/hello">say hello</A><br><br>
#     <A HREF="http://localhost:5000/goodbye">say goodbye</A>
#   </body>
# </html>

# As you can see, each link points to another place in the
# app.
# 
# After saving this page as launch.html, use your browser's
# File > Open File... to navigate to the page and display it.
# You'll see the two links displayed.
# 
# Expected output:
# Click on each one to see that the page calls the Flask app
# and displays the proper template.
