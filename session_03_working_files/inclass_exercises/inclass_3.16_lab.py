# Continue the previous program by using the .json() method of
# the response object to read the data as a JSON object.
# 
# You should find that the object is a dict, that it has one
# key list with a value that is a list, and that if you loop
# through this list of dicts, the key author is the author's
# name, and definition is the definition.
