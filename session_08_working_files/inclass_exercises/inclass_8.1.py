# 8.1:  Import pandas and numpy.  Check the .__version__
# attribute of the pandas module.

# NOTE:  It's recommended to use Jupyter Notebooks for these
# exercises, mostly because it displays DataFrames clearly.
# In the next Session we'll be using a charting library, and
# Notebook will be required.



import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
